Read about the difference between  window, screen and document in javascript 

In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are all important objects, but they represent different aspects of the browsing environment:

Window Object (window):
The window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the document.
It is the global object in client-side JavaScript, meaning that variables and functions declared in the global scope are added as properties and methods of the window object.
It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window, such as dimensions, location, history, and more.

Examples:

// Accessing properties of the window object
console.log(window.innerWidth); // width of the browser window
console.log(window.location.href); // current URL of the page

Screen Object (screen):
The screen object represents the screen on which the browser is being displayed.
It provides properties related to the user's screen, such as width, height, pixel depth, and color depth.

Examples:

// Accessing properties of the screen object
console.log(screen.width); // width of the screen
console.log(screen.height); // height of the screen

Document Object (document):
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides access to the content and structure of the document, allowing JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements, modify content, and respond to user interactions.

Examples:

// Accessing elements in the document
const heading = document.getElementById('heading'); // Get element by ID
const paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p'); // Get elements by tag name

In summary, window deals with the browser window itself, screen deals with the physical screen properties, and document deals with the HTML content loaded in the browser window. Each object serves a distinct purpose in web development and can be used to interact with different aspects of the browsing environment.
